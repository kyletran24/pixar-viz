# Analysis of the success of Pixar movies against popular competitors

This is a solo project I worked on in Data Visualization (CS3281) class at Vanderbilt University taught by Professor Matthew Berger, using the D3 library and SVG on the Observable platform. I deployed this project to kylepixarviz.com using Node.js, AWS and nginx.

## Background and Motivaton 

I had always been a fan of Pixar Studio and their various fascinating animated movies, but I've only interacted with Pixar as a consumer. In this project, I acted on my curiosity as a data visualization student and looked into the data about Pixar movies to analyze their success as a whole as well as juxtapose them against popular competitors like Disney and Dreamworks.

## Data Sets

The data I extracted comes from these 4 data sets:

- Pixar Movies Dataset: https://www.dropbox.com/s/zi9ysyjqrg3ywsp/PixarMovies.csv?dl=0

- Disney Movies Dataset: https://data.world/kgarrett/disney-character-success-00-16/workspace/file?filename=disney_movies_total_gross.csv

- IMDb Movies Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/imdb-extensive-dataset?select=IMDb+ratings.csv

- MovieLens Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset?select=movies_metadata.csv
